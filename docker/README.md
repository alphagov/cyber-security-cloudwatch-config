### Docker

#### THIS IS GENERAL GUIDANCE TAKEN FROM THE CSW CONCOURSE REPO

The CSW Concourse implementation has two docker images in the Docker Hub:

  - **cyber-chalice**

    *The docker image is a ubuntu 18.04 installation with Python 3.6, Python virtual environment, nodejs and terraform installed.*

    Dockerfile for chalice:
      * https://github.com/alphagov/csw-concourse/blob/master/dockerfiles/chalice/Dockerfile

    The command below builds a docker image, which is tagged as latest version, the -t flag also tags it as version 2.0:

    ```
    docker build --no-cache -t gdscyber/cyber-chalice -t gdscyber/cyber-chalice:2.0 .
    ```

    Check DockerHub for the latest version tag.

    Afterwards to push to DockerHub run this command:

    ```
    docker push gdscyber/cyber-chalice:2.0
    ```

    You also have to separately run either of the following for AWS ECS to pick up that this is the latest version:

    ```
    docker push gdscyber/cyber-chalice
    docker push gdscyber/cyber-chalice:latest
    ```

  - **csw-concourse-worker**

    *The docker image is a ubuntu 18.04 installation with Geckodriver and Firefox and Python environment inherited from cyber-chalice image*

    Dockerfile for csw-concourse-worker:
     * https://github.com/alphagov/csw-concourse/blob/master/dockerfiles/csw/Dockerfile


    The command below builds a docker image for the csw-concourse-worker and tags it simultaneously as latest and version 1.3.1:

    ```
    docker build --no-cache -t gdscyber/csw-concourse-worker -t gdscyber/csw-concourse-worker:1.3.1 .
    ```

    Then to push to DockerHub:

    ```
    docker push gdscyber/csw-concourse-worker:1.3.1
    ```
    and
    ```
    docker push gdscyber/csw-concourse-worker:latest
    or
    docker push gdscyber/csw-concourse-worker
    ```


### Concourse
https://cd.gds-reliability.engineering/teams/cybersecurity-tools/pipelines/csw


  * Deploy job (incl. load)
    * Loads prefix and account ID from settings.json for the specified environment.
    * Does installation of dependencies and runs ```aws-assume-role```, ```getsshkey```, ```loadcsw``` and ```deploycsw``` scripts as above.
    * Notifies Slack #cst-tooling-team channel on successful exit or failure.

    * uat-deploy job
      * task ```csw-unit-test``` - installs and activates virtual environment, installs wheel and requirements-dev.txt. Then runs unittest.
      * task ```csw-uat-deploy``` - loads 'uat' environment and runs deploy job.
      * task ```csw-e2e-test``` - runs e2e test on the 'uat' environment as ```e2etest.user```

    * prod-deploy job
      * only runs if ```uat-deploy``` passed
      * task ```csw-prod-deploy``` - runs deploy job in the 'prod' environment.


  * Build job - currently NOT IN USE
    * The build job starts by installing latest Linux updates and generating RSA key pair.
    * It installs and activates virtual environment and package dependencies and runs unittest.
    * It then assumes the ```concourse``` role and saves private and public keys to SSM parameter store.
    * It runs the ```buildcsw``` script and notifies Slack if successful or failing.    


  * Destroy job - currently NOT IN USE
    * After assuming AWS Concourse role and fetching SSH keys this job activates virtual environment and installs dependencies.
    * It runs ```loadcsw``` script then ```gulp environment.cleanup``` for the specified environment and notifies Slack on success/failure.

CSW Concourse pipeline uses variables which are uploaded into Concourse hosting account SSM parameter store.
We have hidden from the pipeline code some variables like cyber staging and production account numbers, concourse role name and slack webhook url.

    The cyber staging account ID:
    ```aws ssm put-parameter \
    --name "/cd/concourse/pipelines/cybersecurity-tools/cyber-staging" \
    --value "103495720024" \
    --type SecureString \
    --key-id "9044a24d-2e69-4058-ba72-52c43dec4979" \
    --overwrite \
    --region eu-west-2
    ```

    Concourse role:
    ```aws ssm put-parameter \
    --name "/cd/concourse/pipelines/cybersecurity-tools/cd-role" \
    --value "cd-cybersecurity-tools-concourse-worker" \
    --type SecureString \
    --key-id "9044a24d-2e69-4058-ba72-52c43dec4979" \
    --overwrite \
    --region eu-west-2
    ```

    Slack webhook configuration:

    ```
    aws ssm put-parameter --cli-input-json '{"Type": "SecureString", "KeyId": "9044a24d-2e6
    9-4058-ba72-52c43dec4979", "Name": "/cd/concourse/pipelines/cybersecurity-tools/slack-webhook-cyber", "Value"
    : "https://hooks.slack.com/services/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" }'  --overwrite --region eu
    -west-2
    ```

### Implementing Concourse pipeline

The csw Concourse pipeline yaml file can be found at ```csw-concourse/pipelines/csw-pipeline.yml```

Once you've made changes to the yaml file you login to concourse and set your target, in this case "cd":

    fly login --target cd -c https://cd.gds-reliability.engineering -n cybersecurity-tools    

The following command will create a new pipeline or amend the existing pipeline script:

    fly -t cd sp -c csw-pipeline.yml -p csw
